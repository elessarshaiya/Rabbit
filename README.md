# Rabbit 
Special Plug for ep6 servers

# What was used?

- Based on Delite
- Dotpeek for a decompile https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/
- It doesn't have names on them because there are still string blocker lamers.
- But you can see what it does when you hover the mouse over it.
- If you do not know which exe is, try in one by one because checkboxes will change the offsets and the game will close.
- If there is a server that you think is not working, share it with me.I won't do it for Ep5 because it already exists.
i did this because i can.
